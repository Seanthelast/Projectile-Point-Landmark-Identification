## Scripts
The Following Scripts apply to the three primary approaches taken by this project:
Single Class Output - A CNN is trained to output a single class of points to act as a control for the other tests
Vector Output - Output multiple classes of poitns as a single vector, with each pair of nubmers to represent a coordinate pair for each class in sequential order 
Multi-Headed Output - Each class has its own output head that outptus a single coordinate pair for that class
